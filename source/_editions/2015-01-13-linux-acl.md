title: Beyond Permissions: Linux ACLs
topics: [Linux ACL]
description: Learn how to use Linux ACL's to give you more power than just regular old permissions.
---

This following video discusses using Linux ACL's instead of the usual Linux user/group/other permissions. This allows for an easier time setting up permissions for automated tasks such as deploying web applications.

> If you're not familiar with "normal" linux user and group permissions, check out [this article](https://serversforhackers.com/permissions-users/) which explains them in a bit more detail.

This video will show setting up ACLs for a directory. These ACL permissions can be inherited by a parent diectories. Setting default ACL's for a location is powerful, as it skips the need to always reset user/group permissions after any file operation (e.g. creating new files) and/or go through the hurdle of configuring umask settings.

Here's the video **Using Linux ACL's**:

## The Rundown:

Here is a rundown of the basic commands we're using:

**$ getfacl /var/www**

* Get current ACL's for the given directory or file

---

**$ setfacl -R -m u:johndoe:rwx /var/www**

* `setfacl` - Set ACL
* `-R` - Recursive down into files and directories
* `-m` - Modifying ACL's (vs removing them)
* `u:johndoe:rwx` - The user johndoe will get rwx permissions
* `/var/www` - Give these permissions to the /var/www directory (and sub files/dirs, since this is a recursive operation via the `-R` flag)

---

**$ setfacl -R -m g:www-data:rwx /var/www**

The same as above, except:

* `g:www-data:rwx` - Allow the group `www-data` to rwx the `/var/www` directory

---

**$ setfacl -x g:www-data /var/www**

* `-x` - Remove ACL's defined for `g:www-data` at location `/var/www`

---

Here are the commands used in the video:

```shell
# Create user jane
root@server $ adduser jane
# Give jane the ability to use "sudo"
root@server $ usermod -a -G sudo jane

# Create user bob
root@server $ adduser bob
# Bob, a user who can deploy web sites, 
# is part of group www-data, the same group as
# our website files
root@server $ usermod -a -G www-data bob

# Ensure the site files have user/group "www-data"
root@server $ chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www

# Check out the ACL's set by default
# These are separate from the usual user/group permissions
root@server $ getfacl /var/www

# Give use jane the ability to rwx web files at
#   directory /var/www
# Technically she wouldn't *need* this, 
# since she has sudo abilities
root@server $ setfacl -R -m u:jane:/var/www

# Above we set ACL for existing files/dirs
# Here we will set the defaults for future files/dirs
root@server $ setfacl -Rd -m u:jane:/var/www

# Check new permissions added
# (current dir/files and defaults)
root@server $ getfacl /var/www

# Add group-based permissions, instead of user-specific
# This allows anyone in group "www-data" (like bob) to
# rwx files in /var/www
# We're setting the defaults here 
root@server $ setfacl -R -m g:www-data:rwx /var/www

# Set the defaults for new files/dirs as well
root@server $ setfacl -Rd -m g:www-data:rwx /var/www

# View changes
root@server $ getfacl /var/www

# !! >> These files/dirs don't need group "www-data" to be editable
# by bob. ANY USER part of group "www-data" can now edit files/dirs
# in directory /var/www!

# Note to keep setfacl flags/options in two groups
# to avoid errors:
root@server $ setfacl
> Usage: setfacl [-bkndRLP] { -m|-M|-x|-X ... } file ...

# Some testing:
# Jane creates a dir
jane@server $ mkdir -p /var/www/site/styles
# Ensure bob can write to that location:
bob@server $ touch /var/www/site/styles/styles.css

# See the ACL's on new dir - they are inherited from parent dir
# Thanks to ACL defaults set
root@server $ getfacl /var/www/site/styles


# Just to be "clean", make site files all 
# part of group www-data
root@server $ chgrp -R www-data /var/www

# Set the gid (group id) used for new dirs/files
# in the /var/www directory - new ones will have 
# group "www-data" just like their parent directory
# 
# This technically isn't necessary, as ACL gorup permissions
# for group "www-data" will function based on the user's assigned
# group rather than the group that is asssigned to the site files
# ...But this is handy to know still
root@server $ chmod -R g+s /var/www

# Check set permissions
# Note the "s" where you usually see "x"
# in the group permissions
bob@server $ ls -lah /var/www
> drwxrwsr-x 3 www-data www-data 4096 Jan 12 20:34 Site
```

Here's the basic situation - a file and directory has three ways to segment permissions:

1. User
2. Group
3. Other

Each of these segments can have read, write or execution permissions.

Combined, this makes for a decent level of permissions. Basically we can set a users permissions. Typically the owning user can read, write and execute (rwx) a directory or file. If we want other users to be able to have permissions of a file or directory, we can:

1. Use group permissions, so members of a group can "rwx" a directory/file.
2. Set the "other" permissions of the file/directory so *anyone* else can "rwx" the directory/file.

If these permissions are limiting, we can use ACL's as an alternative. These are usually in place on install but may need extra installation. The filesystem also needs to enable ACL usage.

> Note about group permissions when over ssh? (scp, rsync, similar)

```shell
$ getfacl /var/www
```

Add multiple group permissions to a file:

```shell
$ sudo setfacl -m g:green:rwx /var/www/
$ sudo setfacl -m g:blue:rwx /var/www/

# remove
$ setfacl -x g:green /var/www
```

Add multiple users permissions to a file:

```shell
$ sudo setfacl -m u:green:rwx /var/www/
$ sudo setfacl -m u:blue:rwx /var/www/

# remove
$ setfacl -x u:green /var/www
```


```
root@server $ adduser fideloper
root@server $ usermod -a -G sudo fideloper

root@server $ setfacl -R -m u:fideloper:rwx /var/www/
root@server $ setfacl -R -m g:www-data:rwx /var/www/
```
