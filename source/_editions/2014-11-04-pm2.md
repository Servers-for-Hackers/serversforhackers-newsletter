## Install

Install Node:

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

Install PM2:

```bash
sudo npm install pm2 -g --unsafe-perm
```


## Web Interface (JSON API)

```bash
pm2 web
```

Listens on `0.0.0.0:9615`. This is also a monitored process, so we can do some inspecting of it:

```bash
# See "tail" style log output of all logs output from processes
pm2 logs

# List processes monitored
pm2 list

# List process 0 (web interface in this case)
pm2 desc 0

# Monitor processes and system usage
pm2 monit
```

## A Sample Application

```javascript
var http = require('http');

function serve(ip, port)
{
     http.createServer(function (req, res) {
        res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'}); // Return a 200 response
        res.write(JSON.stringify(req.headers));             // Respond with request headers
        res.end("\nServer Address: "+ip+":"+port+"\n");     // Let us know the server that responded
    }).listen(port, ip);
    console.log('Server running at http://'+ip+':'+port+'/');
}

serve('127.0.0.1', 9000);
serve('127.0.0.1', 9001);
serve('127.0.0.1', 9002);
```

## Running the Application

```bash
pm2 start app.js --name "myapp" -i max
```

Start monitoring an app named `myapp`. The `-i` flag will start PM2 to attempt to run the process in Cluster mode. It will run as many processes of the application as you have available CPU cores.

We named it `myapp`, which we can use for some commands:

```bash
# Reload and restart the application
pm2 reload myapp

# Stop the application
pm2 stop myapp
```

There are a few other commands you can use as well, such as `gracefulReload`, useful for closing all existing connections before restarting.

## Start on Boot

PM2 is a process monitor, but it itself needs some monitoring! We want it to start on system boot. To do so, we can use an operating system's various boot mechanisms (process monitors).

PM2 has tools to make this very easy for us! It has tools to create startup configurations for Ubuntu, CentOS, Gentoo and anything supporting Systemd.

If you run the command `pm2 startup`, you'll likely be told you need to run the command as root, and get an example script perfect for your operating system. For example, on Ubuntu, I did the following:

```bash
# Run without "root", gives handy message
$ pm2 startup ubuntu
[PM2] You have to run this command as root
[PM2] Execute the following command :
[PM2] sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin pm2 startup ubuntu -u vagrant

# Run the given command with root:
$ sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin pm2 startup ubuntu -u vagrant
```

This setup Ubuntu to start PM2 on boot. Once that's done, run `pm2 save` to have PM2 save the current processes. It will restart these when the system boots back up.

```bash
$ pm2 save
[PM2] Dumping processes
```

This will save file to `/home/USER/.pm2/dump.pm2`. This will save JSON used to configure running processes on startup.

The `.pm2` directory will contain other files as well, such as logs and a place for pids. Pid files are just files with a process id set in its contents.
