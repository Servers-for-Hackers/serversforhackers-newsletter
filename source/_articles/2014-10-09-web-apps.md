Hosting web applications can be complex.

1. Web Server - Acts as a Proxy
2. Gateway - Translates request from web server into web application
3. Application - Our code which takes a request and responds to it

PHP - PHP is different, in Apache it acted like a static file. 
      With PHP-FPM, it's closer to the more common scheme,
      which is why PHP developers sometimes 

To host a web application, a web server can accept an HTTP request and pass it (proxy it) off to a "gateway". The gateway handles converting the request into something an application can understand.

These gateways are various implementations and flavors of a "CGI"s - a [Common Gateway Interfaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface).

For example, many Python applications use the [uWSGI](http://wsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) gateway. Apache will "proxy" a request to the gateway. In turn, the uWSGI gateway passes the request to the Python application.

PHP, when not directly loaded by Apache, can use the PHP-FPM gateway. FPM is an implementation of the [FastCGI](http://www.fastcgi.com/drupal/) gateway, which is a very common protocol.

Apache can also proxy to web applications over HTTP. This is popular when proxying requests to applications listening on HTTP. NodeJS and Golang are two languages that can listen for HTTP connections directly.

Gunicorn and Unicorn are two popular gateways which can communicate over HTTP as well. These can be used to serve Python and Ruby applications, respectively.

T> Note that gateways are commonly tied to specific languages, but some are not!


PHP:
Before we talk about commonly used gateways, let's discuss the glaring exception to the rule. PHP pages and applications are commonly loaded and parsed *directly* by Apache.

In this setup, Apache does not send PHP requests off to a gateway. Instead, Apache uses a PHP module to parse PHP requests directly. This allows PHP files to be used seamlessly alongside static web files.

I> Apache's `mod_php` makes using PHP extremely easy. It's commonly believed that this ease of use made PHP so successful. It is still commonly used.

Running the PHP module in Apache is as simple as installing Apache's `mod_php`. In Ubuntu, the package for that is "libapache2-mod-php5":

Web frameworks of all languages start us with good development environments. We can develop applications, run the "development only" web service, and run web requests against the application.

Things get more complicated when we want to put an application online. We can't just use run `python app.py` or `php -S 0.0.0.0:80` on a server with real traffic.

This article will cover what goes into hosting a web application on a real server.

> A "real server" could be a remote development, staging or production machine. That includes anything that requires more than your local development tools to run requests against your application.

## Three Actors

Hosting web applications generally has three main concerns:

1. The Web Server
2. The Gateway
3. The Application

We'll discuss these in reverse order.

### The Application

1. We code applications
2. Frameworks give us tools to define routes and respond to them
3. We usually can access HTTP request related information
4. Requests to the web server get set to a gateway which in turn send a request into our application.
5. Responses from our application flow the opposite direction
6. Generally our code is an abstraction of HTTP concerns (framework) and business logic conerns (our code)

### The Gateway

1. Sites between Application and Web Server
2. Web Server sends request to Gateway, Gateway Translates to Web application
3. Implementations of CGI
    - CGI, etc, but commonly:
    - FastCGI
    - WSGI
    - (HTTP, too!)
4. Code often has libraries to communicate as needed (WSGI for Python, PHP gets GLOBALS filled, Ruby??)
5. Gateway commonly controls application processes, threads if applicable. Monitors application processes if long-running.

Some code speaks HTTP directly and doesn't need a gateway. NodeJS and Golang are two examples which can listen for HTTP requests and handle them. Usually we send requests directly from web server to these, but don't let users make requests on them directly. Still can use Gateways with them, as they might control processes, etc.

### The Web Server

The web server is something we're all probably pretty familiar with. They excel at serving requested files, but usually serve other purposes as well. One of these purposes is acting as a (reverse) proxy.

1. Accepts request
2. If matches parameters, send request to application
3. Send request [either HTTP, FastCGI, (u)WSGI] to gateway
4. Gateway interprets for application code, returns response
5. Web Server takes care of all HTTP concerns, except for direct application responses (generated HTML, API responses).

### Everything is Supervised

Package managers usually take care of this, but not always. Everything is a process that needs supervision - Web Server, Gateway and Application Processes. Typically we're concerned about server and gateway (gateway takes care of application). NodeJS/Golang apps might also need supervision.

### PHP is Special

PHP confuses developers who don't familiarize themselves with other languages. It behaves like a static file in the typical Apache setup. With Nginx (or Apache with FastCGI) there's more setup, but in the end it still behaves like a file - put up a PHP file, go to it in the browser.

All other languages do **not** behave like this. PHP may be the most popular in part because of this difference. In any case, this is a sticky point when trying out other languages. We not only have to learn new syntaxes and ideas, but then are hit in the face with the question of how to host applications!
