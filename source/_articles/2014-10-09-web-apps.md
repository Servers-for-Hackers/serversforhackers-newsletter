Web frameworks of all languages include a way to run an application in the browser during development.

Things get more complicated when we want to host an application beyond the development environment. We can't just use run `python app.py` or `php -S 0.0.0.0:80` on a server used for real traffic.

This article will cover what goes into hosting a web application on a real server.

> A "real server" in this context is a production server. However it could really be any remote server, whether it's for development, staging, or production.

## Three Actors

Hosting a web application requires the orchestration of three actors:

1. The Application
2. The Gateway
3. The Web Server

### The Application & HTTP Interfaces

Web Applications are generally coded using a framework or suite of libraries. These typically have tooling for handling web requests.

Libraries created to accept and translate HTTP requests are refered to as HTTP Interfaces.

For example, Python has the WSGI specification. A popular implementation of WSGI is Werkzeug. This is a Python library which can accept WSGI-compliant web requests and pass them to an application.

Similiarly, Ruby has Rack. Rack is a specification *and* library that can accept requests of many formats and pass them to an application.

Most languages have HTTP interfaces available. Python and Ruby have HTTP interfaces added on via specifications and libraries. However, many newer languages include HTTP interfaces as part of their standard library. 

NodeJS and Golang are two examples which can listen for HTTP requests "out of the box".

> PHP, notably, is lacking such a specification. However, there are talks of PHP-FIG defining such an interface in [PSR-7](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/http-message.md).

In all cases, web applications must incorporate a way to accept web requests and return valid responses. These are done by incorporating HTTP support in a languages standard libraries, or by adding on specifications and libraries for this support.

To see how applications can receive web requests, we need to discuss application gateways.

<!--
1. We code applications
2. Frameworks give us tools to define routes and respond to them
3. We usually can access HTTP request related information
4. Requests to the web server get set to a gateway which in turn send a request into our application.
5. Responses from our application flow the opposite direction
6. Generally our code is an abstraction of HTTP concerns (framework) and business logic conerns (our code)
-->

### The Gateway

Gateways sit between a web server (Apache, Nginx) and a web application. They typically accept requests from a web server and translate the request to one or more processes of a running web application.

Unfortunately, gateways don't label themselves as such. The exact definition of a gateway is a fluid. 

Some call themselves HTTP servers. Some consider themselves process managers. Others are more of a platform, supporting multiple use cases, protocols, and programming languages.

It might be useful to describe what gateways do rather than pin down an exact definition. Some common functionality of gateways include:

1. Listen for requests (HTTP, FastCGI, uWSGI and more)
2. Translate requests to application code
2. Spawn multiple processes and/or threads of applications
3. Monitor spawned processes
3. Load balance requests between processes
4. Reporting/logging

Many gateways can accept HTTP requests directly. uWSGI, Gunicorn, and Unicorn are examples of such gateways. Note that while Gateways can accept HTTP requests, they still usually sit behind a web server.

Othere protocols are also often supported. For example, uWSGI will accept HTTP, FastCGI and uwsgi (lowercase, the protocol) requests.

> Don't confuse Python's [PEP 3333 (WSGI) specification](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/) with uWSGI's protocol "[uwsgi](http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Protocol.html)". 
> 
> WSGI is Python specification for handling web requests. uWSGI can translate a request to be compatible with WSGI applications.
> 
> Simiarly, uWSGI has it's own specification called "uwsgi". This specifies how other clients can communicate with uWSGI!
> 
> So a web server such as Nginx might "speak" uwsgi in order to communicate with uWSGI. uWSGI, in turn, might translate that request to WSGI in order to communicate with the application. 
> 
> Also know that uWSGI does not *only* implement WSGI.
>
> This web stuff is fun.

PHP-FPM, the gateway for PHP, is an implementation of FastCGI. It will listen for FastCGI requests only.

No matter what protocol is used to accept requests, these gateways can speak a web application's "language. They will translate a web request to application code.

uWSGI or Gunicorn will send requests to a Python application which uses Werkzeug (or any WSGI implementation) to interpret the request.

Unicorn or other Ruby gateways will send requests to a Ruby application using Rack to interpret the request.

The following gateways will speak to WSGI applications:

* Gunicorn
* Tornado
* Gevent
* Twisted Web
* uWSGI

The following gateways will speak to Rack applications:

* Unicorn
* Phusion Passenger
* Thin
* Puma

PHP is, of course, special. Here are ways of hosting/running PHP applications:

* Apache's PHP module can be used to run PHP. This skips over the concept of a gateway, loading in PHP directly. This is the legacy way of running PHP applications. It's ease of setup is partially what made PHP so prominent - it's supported nearly everywhere!
* PHP-FPM is *the* gateway to use for running PHP. It listens for FastCGI connections. Using PHP-FPM is the more modern way to run PHP applications.
* HHVM - HHVM includes a built-in FastCGI implementation. It acts much like PHP-FPM.

<!--
1. Sites between Application and Web Server
2. Web Server sends request to Gateway, Gateway Translates to Web application
3. Implementations of CGI
    - CGI, etc, but commonly:
    - FastCGI
    - WSGI
    - (HTTP, too!)
4. Code often has libraries to communicate as needed (WSGI for Python, PHP gets GLOBALS filled, Ruby??)
5. Gateway commonly controls application processes, threads if applicable. Monitors application processes if long-running.
-->

I mentioned above that some languages include HTTP interfaces in their standard library. Applications built in such languages *can* skip gateways. In that scenario, a web server will send HTTP requests directly to the application.

Such applications can still benefit from the use of a gateway. For example, while NodeJS happens to run as a single-process very efficiently, you may want to use additional processes on a multi-core machine. 

A NodeJS gateway such as [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) could managae multiple processes, allowing for more concurrent application requests to be handled.

> Gateways aren't necessarily language-specific! For example, uWSGI, Gunicorn and Unicorn have all been used with applications of different languages. 
> 
> You'll find that tutorials often match a gateway with applications of a specific language. However this isn't a hard rule. In fact, uWSGI is written in C rather than Python!
> 
> This is why specifications exist. They allow for language-agnostic implementations.

### The Web Server

The web server is something we're all likely familiar with. They excel at serving requested files, but usually serve other purposes as well.

Popular web-server features include:

* Hosting *multiple* sites
* Serving static files
* Proxying requests to other processes
* Load balancing
* HTTP caching
* Streaming media

Here we're concerned with the web server's ability to act as a reverse proxy. 

The web server and the gateway are middlemen between the client and an application. The web server accepts a requests and relays it to a gateway, which translates it to the application. The response is relayed back, eventually reaching the client.

We've discussed how a gateway can accept a request and translate it into something an application can understand.

We only incidentally mentioned how a gateway receives a request. A web server will translate an HTTP request to something a gateway can understand. 

Many gateways listen for HTTP connections. In this case, the web server simply relays the request to the gateway directly.

Other gateways listen for FastCGI or uwsgi connections. Web servers which support these protocols can translate an HTTP request to those protocols. 

Nginx and Apache can both "speak" HTTP, uwsgi, and FastCGI. This covers the basis for communicating with the majority of gateways.

The general flow of a request is as follows:

![application gateway request flow](https://s3.amazonaws.com/serversforhackers/gateway_flow.png)

<!--
1. Accepts request
2. If matches parameters, send request to application
3. Send request [either HTTP, FastCGI, (u)WSGI] to gateway
4. Gateway interprets for application code, returns response
5. Web Server takes care of all HTTP concerns, except for direct application responses (generated HTML, API responses).
-->

### Everything is Supervised

Package managers usually take care of this, but not always. Everything is a process that needs supervision - Web Server, Gateway and Application Processes. Typically we're concerned about server and gateway (gateway takes care of application). NodeJS/Golang apps might also need supervision.

* Upstart
* Systemd
* Supervisord
* Circus

### PHP is Special

PHP confuses developers who don't familiarize themselves with other languages. It behaves like a static file in the typical Apache setup. With Nginx (or Apache with FastCGI) there's more setup, but in the end it still behaves like a file - put up a PHP file, go to it in the browser.

All other languages do **not** behave like this. PHP may be the most popular in part because of this difference. In any case, this is a sticky point when trying out other languages. We not only have to learn new syntaxes and ideas, but then are hit in the face with the question of how to host applications!

> Note we didn't cover JVM-based languages (TomCat, Jetty gateways) here. Outside of my experience.

Hosting web applications can be complex.

1. Web Server - Acts as a Proxy
2. Gateway - Translates request from web server into web application
3. Application - Our code which takes a request and responds to it

PHP - PHP is different, in Apache it acted like a static file. 
      With PHP-FPM, it's closer to the more common scheme,
      which is why PHP developers sometimes 

To host a web application, a web server can accept an HTTP request and pass it (proxy it) off to a "gateway". The gateway handles converting the request into something an application can understand.

These gateways are various implementations and flavors of a "CGI"s - a [Common Gateway Interfaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface).

For example, many Python applications use the [uWSGI](http://wsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) gateway. Apache will "proxy" a request to the gateway. In turn, the uWSGI gateway passes the request to the Python application.

PHP, when not directly loaded by Apache, can use the PHP-FPM gateway. FPM is an implementation of the [FastCGI](http://www.fastcgi.com/drupal/) gateway, which is a very common protocol.

Apache can also proxy to web applications over HTTP. This is popular when proxying requests to applications listening on HTTP. NodeJS and Golang are two languages that can listen for HTTP connections directly.

Gunicorn and Unicorn are two popular gateways which can communicate over HTTP as well. These can be used to serve Python and Ruby applications, respectively.

T> Note that gateways are commonly tied to specific languages, but some are not!


PHP:
Before we talk about commonly used gateways, let's discuss the glaring exception to the rule. PHP pages and applications are commonly loaded and parsed *directly* by Apache.

In this setup, Apache does not send PHP requests off to a gateway. Instead, Apache uses a PHP module to parse PHP requests directly. This allows PHP files to be used seamlessly alongside static web files.

I> Apache's `mod_php` makes using PHP extremely easy. It's commonly believed that this ease of use made PHP so successful. It is still commonly used.

Running the PHP module in Apache is as simple as installing Apache's `mod_php`. In Ubuntu, the package for that is "libapache2-mod-php5":
