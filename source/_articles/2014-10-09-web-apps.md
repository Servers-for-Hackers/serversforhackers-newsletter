Web frameworks of all languages include a way to run an application in the browser during development.

Things get more complicated when we want to host an application beyond the development environment. We can't just use run `python app.py` or `php -S 0.0.0.0:80` on a server used for real traffic.

This article will cover what goes into hosting a web application on a real server.

> A "real server" in this context is a production server. However it could really be any remote server, whether it's for development, staging, or production.

## Three Actors

Hosting a web application requires the orchestration of three actors:

1. The Application
2. The Gateway
3. The Web Server

Here's the general flow of a web request into an application. We'll discuss this flow below, going from right to left.

### The Application & HTTP Interfaces

Web Applications are generally coded using a framework or suite of libraries. These typically have tooling to handle web requests.

Libraries created to accept and translate HTTP requests are referred to as HTTP Interfaces. The HTTP interfaces are used to accept requests of a specified format and translate them into something application code can work with.

For example, Python has the WSGI specification. A popular implementation of WSGI is Werkzeug. This is a Python library that can accept and parse WSGI-compliant web requests.

Similarly, Ruby has Rack. Rack is a specification *and* library that can accept requests of Rack-compliant web requests.

Most languages have HTTP interfaces available. Python and Ruby have HTTP interfaces added on via specifications and libraries. However, many newer languages include HTTP interfaces as part of their standard library. 

NodeJS and Golang are two examples of languages that can listen for HTTP requests directly "out of the box". They don't require a specification such as WSGI or Rack. HTTP requests can be given and parsed directly.

> PHP, notably, is lacking such a specification. However, there are talks of PHP-FIG defining such an interface in [PSR-7](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/http-message.md).

In all cases, web applications must incorporate a way to accept web requests and return valid responses. HTTP support is added in standard libraries or by adding specifications and libraries.

Web requests are given to applications in a specific format. To see *how* applications can receive web requests, we need to discuss application gateways.

The application request flow described is pictured here. It's the flow from a gateway to the application.

<!--
1. We code applications
2. Frameworks give us tools to define routes and respond to them
3. We usually can access HTTP request related information
4. Requests to the web server get set to a gateway which in turn send a request into our application.
5. Responses from our application flow the opposite direction
6. Generally our code is an abstraction of HTTP concerns (framework) and business logic concerns (our code)
-->

### The Gateway

Gateways sit between a web server (Apache, Nginx) and a web application. They typically accept requests from a web server and translate the request to one or more processes of a running web application.

Unfortunately, gateways typically don't label themselves as such. The exact definition of a gateway is somewhat fluid. 

Some call themselves HTTP servers. Some consider themselves process managers. Others are more of a platform, supporting multiple use cases, protocols, and programming languages.

It might be useful to describe what gateways do rather than pin down an exact definition. Some common functionality of gateways include:

1. Listen for requests (HTTP, FastCGI, uWSGI and more)
2. Translate requests to application code
2. Spawn multiple processes and/or threads of applications
3. Monitor spawned processes
3. Load balance requests between processes
4. Reporting/logging

Gateways accept a request and translate it to a web application. For example, a gateway receiving a request meant for a Python application will translate the request into a WSGI-compliant request. A gateway receiving a request for a Rack application will translate the request into a rack-compliant request.

Of course, in order for a gateway to translate a request, they must first receive one.

Many gateways can accept HTTP requests directly. uWSGI, Gunicorn, and Unicorn are examples of such gateways.

Other protocols also may be supported. For example, uWSGI will accept HTTP, FastCGI and uwsgi (lowercase, the protocol) requests.

> Don't confuse Python's [PEP 3333 (WSGI) specification](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/) with uWSGI's protocol "[uwsgi](http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Protocol.html)". 
> 
> WSGI is Python specification for handling web requests. uWSGI can translate a request to be compatible with WSGI applications.
> 
> Similarly, uWSGI has it's own specification called "uwsgi". This specifies how other clients can communicate with uWSGI!

PHP-FPM, the gateway for PHP, is an implementation of FastCGI. It will listen for FastCGI requests only.

A web server such as Nginx might "speak" uwsgi in order to communicate with the gateway uWSGI. uWSGI, in turn, might translate that request to WSGI in order to communicate with an application. The application will accept the WSGI-compliant request and convert it to application code. The library Werkzeug might be the one to do this in a Python application.

No matter what protocol is used to accept requests, these gateways can accept a request and translate it to speak a web application's "language. The language will accept the request and make it usable in the application.

The following gateways will speak to WSGI applications:

* Gunicorn
* Tornado
* Gevent
* Twisted Web
* uWSGI

The following gateways will speak to Rack applications:

* Unicorn
* Phusion Passenger
* Thin
* Puma

PHP is, of course, special. Here are ways of hosting/running PHP applications:

* Apache's PHP module can be used to run PHP. This skips over the concept of a gateway, loading in PHP directly. This is the legacy way of running PHP applications. It's ease of setup is partially what made PHP so prominent - it's supported nearly everywhere!
* PHP-FPM is *the* gateway to use for running PHP. It listens for FastCGI connections. Using PHP-FPM is the more modern way to run PHP applications.
* HHVM - HHVM includes a built-in FastCGI implementation. It acts much like PHP-FPM.

<!--

    - CGI, etc, but commonly:
    - FastCGI
    - WSGI
    - (HTTP, too!)
4. Code often has libraries to communicate as needed (WSGI for Python, PHP gets GLOBALS filled, Ruby??)
5. Gateway commonly controls application processes, threads if applicable. Monitors application processes if long-running.
-->

I mentioned above that some languages include HTTP interfaces in their standard library. Applications built in such languages *can* skip gateways. In that scenario, a web server will send HTTP requests directly to the application.

Such applications can still benefit from the use of a gateway. For example, while NodeJS happens to run as a single-process very efficiently, you may want to use multiple processes on a multi-core server. 

A NodeJS gateway such as [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2) could manage multiple processes, allowing for more concurrent application requests to be handled.

> Gateways aren't necessarily language-specific! For example, uWSGI, Gunicorn and Unicorn have all been used with applications of various languages. 
> 
> You'll find that tutorials often match a gateway with applications of a specific language. However this isn't a hard rule. In fact, uWSGI is written in C rather than Python!

> This is why specifications exist. They allow for language-agnostic implementations.

The gateway request flow described is pictured here. It's the flow from a web server to the gateway and from the gateway to the application.

### The Web Server

Web servers excel at serving requested files, but usually serve other purposes as well.

Popular web-server features include:

* Hosting *multiple* sites
* Serving static files
* Proxying requests to other processes
* Load balancing
* HTTP caching
* Streaming media

Here we're concerned with the web server's ability to act as a (reverse) proxy.

The web server and the gateway are middlemen between the client and an application. The web server accepts a request and relays it to a gateway, which in turn translates it to the application. The response is relayed back, finally reaching the client.

We've discussed how a gateway can accept a request and translate it into something an application can understand.

As mentioned, a web server will translate an HTTP request to something a gateway can understand.

Some gateways actually listen for HTTP connections. In this case, the web server can relay the HTTP request to the gateway directly.

Other gateways listen for FastCGI or uwsgi connections. Web servers which support these protocols must translate an HTTP request to those protocols first.

Nginx and Apache can both "speak" HTTP, uwsgi, and FastCGI. This covers the basis for communicating with the majority of gateways. These web servers will accept an HTTP request and relay them to a gateway in whichever protocol the gateway needs.

> More specifically, the web server will translate a request into whatever you configure it to use. It's up to the developer/sysadmin to configure the web server correctly.

The web server request flow described is pictured here. It's the flow from the client to the web server and from the web server to the gateway.

![application gateway request flow](https://s3.amazonaws.com/serversforhackers/gateway_flow.png)

<!--
1. Accepts request
2. If matches parameters, send request to application
3. Send request [either HTTP, FastCGI, (u)WSGI] to gateway
4. Gateway interprets for application code, returns response
5. Web Server takes care of all HTTP concerns, except for direct application responses (generated HTML, API responses).

### PHP is Special

PHP is unique in that it's a language built specifically for the web.

Most other languages are either general purpose, or have other specific purposes. As a result, PHP is fairly different in how it handles HTTP requests relative to other languages.

PHP was originally built under the assumption that it is run during an HTTP request. It contained no process for converting the bytes of an HTTP request into something for code to handle. By the time the code was run, that was dealt with.

> PHP is no longer limited to being run within context of an HTTP request. However, running PHP outside of a web request was an evolution of PHP, not a starting point. PHP still has its environment/request data setup before it is run.

Conversely, other languages have a process of translating a request into code. This usually means parsing the bytes constituting HTTP request data. 

Many libraries have been created as a language add-on to to handle HTTP requests. Some newer languages can actually handle HTTP requests directly. These don't assume code is always run in the context of an HTTP request, however.

This process in PHP is roughly equivalent to using cURL (or perhaps the Guzzle package) to accept web requests.

On a practical level, this means that PHP's super globals (`$_SERVER`, `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_SESSION`, `$_COOKIE` and so on) are already populated by the time your PHP code is run. PHP doesn't need to do work to get this data.

PHP-FPM, the gateway for PHP, takes a web request's data and fills in the PHP super globals. It sets up the state of the request (the environment) before running code.

PHP never needed a specification or library for accepting bytes of data and converting it to a request. It's already done by the time PHP code is run! This is great for simplicity.

Modern applications, however, are not often simple. For more structured applications ("Enterprise"), we often need to deal with HTTP responses in great detail. Perhaps we want to encrypt cookies, or set cache headers. 

This often requires us to write objects *describing* HTTP. These objects are populated by PHP's environment state (mostly from the super globals). These then can be used to adjust HTTP-related state, hopefully applying correct HTTP business logic and constraints. 

Under the hood, such libraries use PHP's built in HTTP-related functions to read in the request and create a response.

Popular examples of these libraries includes Symfony's HTTP libraries, and the possible PSR-7 standard.

> An HTTP interface can help standardize and encapuslate HTTP concerns as well. This is great for testing in PHP. Super globals and managing state can often lead to issues in testing and code quality.

For the end-user (developer), that's a subtle difference between PHP and other languages. This difference is often hidden to use end-user developers.

Languages like Python and Ruby have a specification for how raw HTTP information should be sent. It's then up to frameworks and libraries to handle getting/setting cookies, sessions, query data, headers and so on. Additionally, code manipulating response data must be written to send responses in the proper HTTP format.

On the other hand, PHP frameworks simply manipulate HTTP request state given. For HTTP responses, PHP has built-in methods to let you adjust HTTP headers and data. 

> Retrieving the data set in the super globals yourself in PHP is actually very hard!

This means PHP developers don't need to directly concern themselves with how data gets translated into a HTTP response. Instead, that's a concern for the internals team.
